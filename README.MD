# Everything you need for game development in Javascript.

Javascript, while extremely slow, does not require recompilation for new targets and is extra-ordinarily
portable.

This makes it a superb choice for most game development, where in most cases, performance is not that important.

This isn't the right choice if you want to write the next realistic immersive 3d game, of course.
